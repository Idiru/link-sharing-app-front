<u>Update User Profile:</u> Allows users to update their profile information and submit it to the backend server.
Here are the steps and API calls used:

<u>Fetching User Data:</u> Upon mounting, the component fetches the user data using the endpoint:
GET: /auth/users/${id} 
<u>Updating User Data:</u> On submitting the form, it sends the updated data to the backend:
PUT: /auth/update/${id}

Initialization involves fetching current user data from the backend, ensuring the form is initially populated with the user's existing information.

Form Handling employs the useReducer hook to manage the state of form fields, ensuring controlled input handling and synchronization with UI updates.

File Upload functionality manages the selection and preview of profile images, enabling users to upload new images and view them before submission.

Data Submission occurs when users finalize their updates. It involves packaging form data, including any newly uploaded profile images, into a FormData object. This object is then sent to the backend server via a PUT request to update the user's profile using the appropriate endpoint. This comprehensive approach ensures seamless interaction between the frontend and backend systems, maintaining user data integrity and enhancing user experience.

## BuilderPage component

### Overview

The BuilderPage component is part of the application that allows users to manage links and content dynamically. It integrates various features such as adding new links, updating, and removing existing ones. This component utilizes React hooks for state management and interacts with a backend via axios for data persistence.

### Core functionalities

- <u>**Add new Links:**</u> Users can add new links through a dedicated button which instantiates a new link object. This link is initially marked as 'new', allowing the system to distinguish unsaved changes.

- <u>**Edit links:**</u> Each link can be edited directly from the interface. Changes to the linkâ€™s platform, title, or URL are tracked instantaneously, updating the state of the link to 'updated' unless it is a newly added link, which retains the 'new' state until saved.

- <u>**Remove links:**</u> Links can be removed by marking them as 'deleted' within the internal state. This does not immediately remove the link from the visible list but excludes it from being saved or manipulated further.

The whole content is store inside the state variable `content`, the key state allows us to know that should be done later when you click on the Save button.

After clicking on the Save button, the link to the back-end is done thanks to the `handleSave`function which will do the right API call (POST, PUT or DELETE) for each content item according to the state (exemple: if state = new then POST request).

The link to the user is made directly by the back-end thanks to the JWT token.

Here are the enpoints used:

- To create a new content: `/content/create`
- To update and delete a content (PUT request for the first one and DELETE for the second one): `/content/${item._id}`
